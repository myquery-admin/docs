## **Security & Architecture Overview**

Before connecting your data, it is critical to understand how MyQuery interacts with your infrastructure:

- **Schema-Only Access:** MyQuery does **not** ingest or store your raw database records. We only read the metadata (table names, column types, and foreign key relationships) to build a semantic map for the AI.
- **Encrypted Storage:** All connection credentials and "maps" are encrypted at rest using industry-standard AES-256 encryption.
- **Whitelisting:** To allow MyQuery to reach your database, you must whitelist our outbound IP addresses in your firewall or cloud security groups (e.g., AWS Security Groups, Azure Firewall).

### **Method A: Connection Parameters**

- **Host/Port/User/Password:** Standard connectivity fields (Default Port: 

  ```
  5432
  ```

  ).
- **Database:** The name of the target database.
- **Enable SSL:**
  - _Requirement:_ Essential for almost all cloud-hosted Postgres instances. If your database requires an encrypted tunnel, ensure this is toggled to **True**.

### **Method B: Connection String**

- **Format:** 

  ```
  postgresql://[user]:[password]@[host]:[port]/[database]?sslmode=[mode]
  ```
- **Example:** 

  ```
  postgresql://admin:pass123@ep-cool-planet-123.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
  ```
