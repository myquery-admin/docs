## **Security & Architecture Overview**

Before connecting your data, it is critical to understand how MyQuery interacts with your infrastructure:

- **Schema-Only Access:** MyQuery does **not** ingest or store your raw database records. We only read the metadata (table names, column types, and foreign key relationships) to build a semantic map for the AI.
- **Encrypted Storage:** All connection credentials and "maps" are encrypted at rest using industry-standard AES-256 encryption.
- **Whitelisting:** To allow MyQuery to reach your database, you must whitelist our outbound IP addresses in your firewall or cloud security groups (e.g., AWS Security Groups, Azure Firewall).

### **Connection Method: Service Account JSON**

- **Step 1: Create Service Account:** In Google Cloud Console, create a service account named 

  ```
  myquery-access
  ```

  .
- **Step 2: Assign Roles:** to read schema Grant:

  ```
  BigQuery
  ```

  to run queries: 

  ```
  BigQuery Job User
  ```
- **Step 3: Export Key:** Generate a **JSON Key** and download it.
- **Step 4: Connect:** Open the JSON file, copy the object, and paste it into the **Credentials JSON** box in MyQuery.
- **Dataset:** Provide the name of the dataset containing your tables (e.g., 

  ```
  marketing_insights
  ```

  ).
