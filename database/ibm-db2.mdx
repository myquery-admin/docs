## **Security & Architecture Overview**

Before connecting your data, it is critical to understand how MyQuery interacts with your infrastructure:

- **Schema-Only Access:** MyQuery does **not** ingest or store your raw database records. We only read the metadata (table names, column types, and foreign key relationships) to build a semantic map for the AI.
- **Encrypted Storage:** All connection credentials and "maps" are encrypted at rest using industry-standard AES-256 encryption.
- **Whitelisting:** To allow MyQuery to reach your database, you must whitelist our outbound IP addresses in your firewall or cloud security groups (e.g., AWS Security Groups, Azure Firewall).

### **Method A: Parameters**

- **Host/Port:** Default port is

  ```
  50000
  ```
- **Database:** The target database name.
- **User ID / Password:** Your instance-level credentials.

### **Method B: Credentials JSON (IBM Cloud)**

If you are using **IBM Cloud "Db2 on Cloud"**, navigate to the "Service Credentials" tab in your IBM dashboard.

- **Step:** Copy the entire JSON block and paste it into the **Credentials JSON** textarea in MyQuery.
- **Context:** This automatically handles complex authentication and endpoint routing provided by IBM.
