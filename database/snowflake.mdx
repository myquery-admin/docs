## **Security & Architecture Overview**

Before connecting your data, it is critical to understand how MyQuery interacts with your infrastructure:

- **Schema-Only Access:** MyQuery does **not** ingest or store your raw database records. We only read the metadata (table names, column types, and foreign key relationships) to build a semantic map for the AI.
- **Encrypted Storage:** All connection credentials and "maps" are encrypted at rest using industry-standard AES-256 encryption.
- **Whitelisting:** To allow MyQuery to reach your database, you must whitelist our outbound IP addresses in your firewall or cloud security groups (e.g., AWS Security Groups, Azure Firewall).

### **Method A: Password Authentication**

- **Account:** Your Snowflake account identifier.
  - _Note:_ Do not include

    ```
    .snowflakecomputing.com
    ```

    . (Example:

    ```
    ab12345.us-east-1
    ```

    ).
- **Username / Password:** Standard Snowflake user credentials.
- **Warehouse:** The engine name (e.g.,

  ```
  COMPUTE_WH
  ```

  ).
- **Database & Schema:** The path to find the objects.
- **Role (Optional):** Define the security context. e.g.,

  ```
  SYSADMIN
  ```

  or if your user has multiple roles:

  ```
  ANALYST
  ```

### **Method B: Key Pair Authentication**

- **Private Key:** Paste your unencrypted RSA private key in PEM format. This is the most secure method for service-to-service communication.
