## **Security & Architecture Overview**

Before connecting your data, it is critical to understand how MyQuery interacts with your infrastructure:

- **Schema-Only Access:** MyQuery does **not** ingest or store your raw database records. We only read the metadata (table names, column types, and foreign key relationships) to build a semantic map for the AI.
- **Encrypted Storage:** All connection credentials and "maps" are encrypted at rest using industry-standard AES-256 encryption.
- **Whitelisting:** To allow MyQuery to reach your database, you must whitelist our outbound IP addresses in your firewall or cloud security groups (e.g., AWS Security Groups, Azure Firewall).

\
**Method A: Connection Parameters (Standard)**

This is the recommended approach for most users. It provides clear fields for each variable.

- **Host:** The resolvable address of the server.
  - _Example:_ 

    ```
    db-prod-01.company.com
    ```

    or 

    ```
    10.0.0.5
    ```

    .
- **Port:** The network port the service is listening on.
  - _Default:_ 

    ```
    3306
    ```

    .
- **Database:** The specific schema name you want to query.
  - _Example:_ 

    ```
    customer_success_v2
    ```

    .
- **Username:** A database user with 

  ```
  SELECT
  ```

  permissions.
  - _Example:_ 

    ```
    myquery_read_only
    ```

    .
- **Password:** The associated credential for the user.

### **Method B: Connection String (Advanced)**

Provides a way to pass custom driver flags in a single URI.

- **Format:** 

  ```
  mysql://[user]:[password]@[host]:[port]/[database]
  ```
- **Example:** 

  ```
  mysql://readonly_user:SecurePass123@db.example.com:3306/production_data?ssl-mode=REQUIRED
  ```
