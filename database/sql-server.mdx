description: "To connect your Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) database to MyQuery, follow these steps and provide the required information for your connection method."

## **Security & Architecture Overview**

Before connecting your data, it is critical to understand how MyQuery interacts with your infrastructure:

- **Schema-Only Access:** MyQuery does **not** ingest or store your raw database records. We only read the metadata (table names, column types, and foreign key relationships) to build a semantic map for the AI.
- **Encrypted Storage:** All connection credentials and "maps" are encrypted at rest using industry-standard AES-256 encryption.
- **Whitelisting:** To allow MyQuery to reach your database, you must whitelist our outbound IP addresses in your firewall or cloud security groups (e.g., AWS Security Groups, Azure Firewall).

### **1. Select Connection Method**

When adding a new SQL Server connection, you can choose between two main tabs:

- **Connection Parameters:** Best for standard setups using individual fields.
- **Connection String:** Best if you already have a formatted driver string.

### **2. Field Definitions**

#### **📡 Connection Parameters (Standard)**

- **Server (Required):** The hostname, IP address, or named instance of your SQL Server.
  - _Example:_

    ```
    192.168.1.10
    ```

    or

    ```
    db-server.yourcompany.com
    ```

    or

    ```
    localhost\SQLEXPRESS
    ```

    .
- **Database (Required):** The specific database name within the server that you want the AI to access.
  - _Example:_

    ```
    SalesDB
    ```

    or

    ```
    Inventory_Production
    ```

    .
- **Username (Required):** The database-level user account created for MyQuery.
  - _Example:_

    ```
    myquery_user
    ```

    .
- **Password (Required):** The password associated with the username above.
- **Port (Optional):** The network port SQL Server is listening on.
  - _Default:_

    ```
    1433
    ```

    .
- **Encrypt (Optional):** Set to

  ```
  true
  ```

  if your server requires encrypted connections (SSL/TLS).
  - _Default:_

    ```
    false
    ```

    .

#### **🔗 Connection String (Advanced)**

- **Connection String (Required):** A complete driver-specific string containing all credentials.
  - _Format:_

    ```
    Server=your_server;Database=your_db;User Id=your_user;Password=your_password;
    ```

### **3. Connection Steps**

1. **Enter Credentials:** Fill in the fields described above based on your chosen method.
2. **Test Connection:** Click the **Test Connection** button. MyQuery will attempt to reach your server to verify the "Schema-only" access.
3. **Select Tables:** Once verified, you will be presented with a list of available tables. Check the boxes for the data you want the AI to be able to "read."
4. **Train AI:** Click **Finish Setup**. The AI will now analyze the blueprint (schema) of your selected tables so it can begin answering your questions!
