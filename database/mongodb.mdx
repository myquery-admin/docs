## **Security & Architecture Overview**

Before connecting your data, it is critical to understand how MyQuery interacts with your infrastructure:

- **Schema-Only Access:** MyQuery does **not** ingest or store your raw database records. We only read the metadata (table names, column types, and foreign key relationships) to build a semantic map for the AI.
- **Encrypted Storage:** All connection credentials and "maps" are encrypted at rest using industry-standard AES-256 encryption.
- **Whitelisting:** To allow MyQuery to reach your database, you must whitelist our outbound IP addresses in your firewall or cloud security groups (e.g., AWS Security Groups, Azure Firewall)

### **Connection Method: URI String**

MongoDB connections are handled exclusively via the official SRV or Standard connection string format.

- **Field:** **Connection String**
- **Format:**

  ```
  mongodb+srv://[user]:[password]@[host]/[database]?options
  ```
- **Example:**

  ```
  mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster0.abcde.mongodb.net/analytics_db?retryWrites=true&w=majority
  ```
- **Security Tip:** Ensure your MongoDB user has the

  ```
  read
  ```

  role specifically on the database mentioned in the string.
