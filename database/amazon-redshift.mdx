## **Security & Architecture Overview**

Before connecting your data, it is critical to understand how MyQuery interacts with your infrastructure:

- **Schema-Only Access:** MyQuery does **not** ingest or store your raw database records. We only read the metadata (table names, column types, and foreign key relationships) to build a semantic map for the AI.
- **Encrypted Storage:** All connection credentials and "maps" are encrypted at rest using industry-standard AES-256 encryption.
- **Whitelisting:** To allow MyQuery to reach your database, you must whitelist our outbound IP addresses in your firewall or cloud security groups (e.g., AWS Security Groups, Azure Firewall).

### **Method A: Parameters (Provisioned Cluster)**

- **Host:** Your cluster endpoint (looks like):

  ```
  my-cluster.xyz.us-east-1.redshift.amazonaws.com
  ```
- **Port:** Default is 

  ```
  5439
  ```
- **Database:** Typically 

  ```
  dev
  ```

  or your custom name.
- **Schema:** Highly recommended to define this. e.g., 

  ```
  public
  ```

  or 

  ```
  staging
  ```

### **Method B: AWS Serverless / SDK Access**

Permits connection without exposing your Redshift cluster to the public internet via TCP.

- **Workgroup Name:** For Redshift Serverless users.
- **AWS Region:** e.g., 

  ```
  us-west-2
  ```
- **AWS Access Key ID:** IAM user with 

  ```
  AmazonRedshiftFullAccess
  ```

  or specific Data API permissions.
- **AWS Secret Access Key:** The associated secret for the IAM user.
