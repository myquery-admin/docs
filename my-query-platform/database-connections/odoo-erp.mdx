## **Security & Architecture Overview**

Before connecting your data, it is critical to understand how MyQuery interacts with your infrastructure:

- **Schema-Only Access:** MyQuery does **not** ingest or store your raw database records. We only read the metadata (table names, column types, and foreign key relationships) to build a semantic map for the AI.
- **Encrypted Storage:** All connection credentials and "maps" are encrypted at rest using industry-standard AES-256 encryption.
- **Whitelisting:** To allow MyQuery to reach your database, you must whitelist our outbound IP addresses in your firewall or cloud security groups (e.g., AWS Security Groups, Azure Firewall).

### **Method A: Password Auth**

- **URL:** Your Odoo instance address.
- **Database:** The Odoo system database name.
- **Username/Password:** Your Odoo login credentials.

### **Method B: API Key Auth**

- **API Key:** Recommended for automated access. Provide the generated Odoo API key instead of your user password.
