## **Security & Architecture Overview**

Before connecting your data, it is critical to understand how MyQuery interacts with your infrastructure:

- **Schema-Only Access:** MyQuery does **not** ingest or store your raw database records. We only read the metadata (table names, column types, and foreign key relationships) to build a semantic map for the AI.
- **Encrypted Storage:** All connection credentials and "maps" are encrypted at rest using industry-standard AES-256 encryption.
- **Whitelisting:** To allow MyQuery to reach your database, you must whitelist our outbound IP addresses in your firewall or cloud security groups (e.g., AWS Security Groups, Azure Firewall).

### **Connection Method: HTTP Path**

- **Host (Required):** Your Databricks workspace URL (e.g.,

  ```
  adb-1234567.8.azuredatabricks.net
  ```

  ).
- **HTTP Path (Required):** Found in your SQL Warehouse settings under "Connection Details."
  - _Example:_

    ```
    /sql/1.0/warehouses/abc1234567890efg
    ```

    .
- **Access Token (Required):** A Personal Access Token (PAT) generated from your Databricks User Settings.
