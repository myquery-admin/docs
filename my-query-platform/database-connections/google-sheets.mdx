## **Security & Architecture Overview**

Before connecting your data, it is critical to understand how MyQuery interacts with your infrastructure:

- **Schema-Only Access:** MyQuery does **not** ingest or store your raw database records. We only read the metadata (table names, column types, and foreign key relationships) to build a semantic map for the AI.
- **Encrypted Storage:** All connection credentials and "maps" are encrypted at rest using industry-standard AES-256 encryption.
- **Whitelisting:** To allow MyQuery to reach your database, you must whitelist our outbound IP addresses in your firewall or cloud security groups (e.g., AWS Security Groups, Azure Firewall).

**Setup Steps:**

1. Click **Connect Google Sheets**.
2. Authorize MyQuery to access your Google Drive/Sheets.
3. **File Selection:** Use the file picker to find the specific Spreadsheet.
4. **Sheet Selection:** Define which "Sheet" (tab) within the file should be treated as the table.
5. **Headers:** Ensure your first row contains the column names. MyQuery will automatically map these names as table columns.
