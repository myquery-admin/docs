## **Security & Architecture Overview**

Before connecting your data, it is critical to understand how MyQuery interacts with your infrastructure:

- **Schema-Only Access:** MyQuery does **not** ingest or store your raw database records. We only read the metadata (table names, column types, and foreign key relationships) to build a semantic map for the AI.
- **Encrypted Storage:** All connection credentials and "maps" are encrypted at rest using industry-standard AES-256 encryption.
- **Whitelisting:** To allow MyQuery to reach your database, you must whitelist our outbound IP addresses in your firewall or cloud security groups (e.g., AWS Security Groups, Azure Firewall).

### **Method A: Parameters**

- **Host/Port/User/Password:** Standard MySQL-compatible connection (Default Port:

  ```
  3306
  ```

  ).
- **Database:** Target database name.

### **Method B: Connection String**

- **Example:**

  ```
  singlestore://user:pass@svc-abc-ddl.aws-virginia-1.db.singlestore.com:3306/mydb
  ```
