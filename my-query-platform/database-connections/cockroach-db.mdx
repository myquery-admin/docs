## **Security & Architecture Overview**

Before connecting your data, it is critical to understand how MyQuery interacts with your infrastructure:

- **Schema-Only Access:** MyQuery does **not** ingest or store your raw database records. We only read the metadata (table names, column types, and foreign key relationships) to build a semantic map for the AI.
- **Encrypted Storage:** All connection credentials and "maps" are encrypted at rest using industry-standard AES-256 encryption.
- **Whitelisting:** To allow MyQuery to reach your database, you must whitelist our outbound IP addresses in your firewall or cloud security groups (e.g., AWS Security Groups, Azure Firewall).

### **Method A: Connection Parameters**

- **Host (Required):** The cluster endpoint or node address.
- **Port (Optional):** Default is

  ```
  26257
  ```

  .
- **Database (Required):** The specific database within the cluster.
- **Username/Password:** Standard SQL credentials.

### **Method B: Connection String**

- **Format:**

  ```
  postgresql://[user]:[password]@[host]:26257/[database]?sslmode=verify-full
  ```
- **Example:**

  ```
  postgresql://jane:pass123@my-cluster-1234.gcp-us-east1.cockroachlabs.cloud:26257/defaultdb?sslmode=verify-full
  ```
