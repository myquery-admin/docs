## **Security & Architecture Overview**

Before connecting your data, it is critical to understand how MyQuery interacts with your infrastructure:

- **Schema-Only Access:** MyQuery does **not** ingest or store your raw database records. We only read the metadata (table names, column types, and foreign key relationships) to build a semantic map for the AI.
- **Encrypted Storage:** All connection credentials and "maps" are encrypted at rest using industry-standard AES-256 encryption.
- **Whitelisting:** To allow MyQuery to reach your database, you must whitelist our outbound IP addresses in your firewall or cloud security groups (e.g., AWS Security Groups, Azure Firewall).

### **Method A: Basic Auth**

- **Node URL:** e.g.,

  ```
  http://localhost:9200
  ```

  .
- **Username/Password:** Standard Elastic credentials.

### **Method B: Elastic Cloud (Cloud ID)**

- **Cloud ID:** The unique string from your Elastic Cloud dashboard.
- **API Key:** Recommended over passwords for cloud deployments.
  - _Format:_

    ```
    id:secret
    ```
