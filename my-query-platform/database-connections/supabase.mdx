## **Security & Architecture Overview**

Before connecting your data, it is critical to understand how MyQuery interacts with your infrastructure:

- **Schema-Only Access:** MyQuery does **not** ingest or store your raw database records. We only read the metadata (table names, column types, and foreign key relationships) to build a semantic map for the AI.
- **Encrypted Storage:** All connection credentials and "maps" are encrypted at rest using industry-standard AES-256 encryption.
- **Whitelisting:** To allow MyQuery to reach your database, you must whitelist our outbound IP addresses in your firewall or cloud security groups (e.g., AWS Security Groups, Azure Firewall).

#### **Method A: OAuth Flow (Recommended)**

1. Click **Connect Supabase**.
2. You will be redirected to the Supabase dashboard to authorize MyQuery.
3. Select the **Project** you wish to connect.
4. MyQuery automatically securely imports the API keys and database endpoints.

#### **Method B: Direct Connection**

Since Supabase is built on PostgreSQL, you can also use the **PostgreSQL** tab with your Supabase "Connection Info" Host ending in:

```
.supabase.co
```

, Port:

```
5432
```

and your database password.
