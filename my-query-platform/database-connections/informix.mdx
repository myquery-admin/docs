## **Security & Architecture Overview**

Before connecting your data, it is critical to understand how MyQuery interacts with your infrastructure:

- **Schema-Only Access:** MyQuery does **not** ingest or store your raw database records. We only read the metadata (table names, column types, and foreign key relationships) to build a semantic map for the AI.
- **Encrypted Storage:** All connection credentials and "maps" are encrypted at rest using industry-standard AES-256 encryption.
- **Whitelisting:** To allow MyQuery to reach your database, you must whitelist our outbound IP addresses in your firewall or cloud security groups (e.g., AWS Security Groups, Azure Firewall).

#### **Method A: Connection Parameters (Standard)**

This is the most common way to connect to a local or on-premise Informix instance.

- **Host (Required):** The IP address or hostname of the server.
  - _Example:_

    ```
    informix.corp.internal
    ```

    or

    ```
    10.50.0.12
    ```

    .
- **Port (Required):** The service port the database is listening on.
  - _Default:_

    ```
    9088
    ```

    .
- **Database (Required):** The name of the specific Informix database.
- **Username / Password (Required):** Your database user credentials.
- **Server Name (Optional):** The name of the Informix engine instance.
  - _Default:_

    ```
    informix
    ```

    .
- **Protocol (Optional):** The network protocol used for communication.
  - _Default:_

    ```
    onsoctcp
    ```

    .

#### **Method B: Connection String (Advanced)**

Perfect for passing multiple specific parameters in a single line.

- **Format:**

  ```
  HOST=[host];SERVICE=[port];SERVER=[server];DATABASE=[db];PROTOCOL=[proto];UID=[user];PWD=[pass]
  ```
- **Example:**

  ```
  HOST=123.456.78.9;SERVICE=9088;SERVER=ol_informix1210;DATABASE=sales_db;PROTOCOL=onsoctcp;UID=admin;PWD=mypassword;
  ```
