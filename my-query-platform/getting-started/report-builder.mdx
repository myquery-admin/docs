---

## **1. Asking Your First Question**

At the bottom of the chat interface, you'll find a search bar. You can type any question related to your database, such as:

- _"What are the top 10 customers by total spend this year?"_
- _"Show me a monthly trend of new signups in 2023."_
- _"Which products are low on stock in the 'Electronics' category?"_

**Tip:** If you're not sure where to start, look for the **Suggested Queries** above the input box. These are generated specifically for your database to help you discover insights quickly.

## **2. Navigating the Results**

Once you submit a question, MyQuery generates three ways to interact with your data:

### **Chart View (Visual Insights)**

MyQuery automatically selects the best visualization for your data (e.g., Bar chart, Line graph, or Pie chart).

- **Change Chart Type:** Use the selector on the right to switch between visualizations like Area, Scatter, or Waterfall.
- **Customize Data:** If your data is complex, the system provides **Pivot Configurations** to group, stack, or aggregate data exactly how you need it.

### **Result View (Interactive Table)**

For deeper analysis of raw data, click the **Result** tab. This view offers powerful tools:

- **Searching & Filtering:** Use the search bar in the table header to find specific records. Use the **Filter** button to add complex rules (e.g., _"Price is greater than 100"_).
- **Sorting:** Click any column header to sort the data in ascending or descending order.
- **Pagination:** If your query returns many rows, use the pagination controls at the bottom to browse through pages.
- **Column Selection:** Click the column icon to hide or show specific fields in your table.

### **Query View (For Advanced Users)**

View the exact logic used to fetch your data.

- **Edit & Re-run:** If the AI didn't get it quite right, you can click **Edit**, modify the code directly, and hit **Play** to see the updated results.
- **Copy:** Use the **Copy** icon to share the logic with teammates or use it in other tools.

## **3. Advanced Features**

- **Fullscreen Mode:** Need more space? Use the **Expand** icon (top right of the response) to open the table or chart in a larger view.
- **Refine Your Search:** Like a real conversation, you can ask follow-up questions. For example, after asking for sales, you can say: _"Now show me just the 'North' region."_

---

## **4. Managing Your Conversations**

- **History Sidebar:** All your past chats are saved automatically. Access them anytime from the left sidebar to pick up where you left off.
- **Loading Previous Messages:** For long investigations, click **"Load Previous Messages"** at the top of the chat to see older context.
- **New Chat:** To start a fresh analysis, click the "**New Chat" **button in the Side bar. This cleans your workspace and start new conversation but keeps your old chats safely in the sidebar.

---

## **5. Usage & Credits**

Your account comes with a monthly allowance of AI queries.

- **Real-time Tracking:** The system will notify you if you are running low on queries.
- **Addon Credits:** If you reach your limit, you can easily top up credits to keep your analysis moving without waiting for the next month.
- **Usage Breakdown:** View exactly how many queries you've used across your team in the dashboard usage statistics.

## **6. Self-Healing Intelligence**

Sometimes databases can be tricky. If your query encounters a technical error, MyQuery's **Auto-Fix** feature kicks in. You'll see the system attempting to fix the query automatically in the background, ensuring you get your answer without manual troubleshooting.
