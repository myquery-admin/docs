## **1. Profile & Account**

In the **Profile** tab, you can manage your identity within the platform:

- **Update Your Info:** Click **Edit Profile** to update your Full Name or your Organization’s display name.
- **Account Details:** View your registered email, current role (e.g., Member, Admin), and the date your account was created.
- **Plan Summary:** Quickly see which subscription plan your organization is currently on (e.g., Free, Pro, Enterprise).

## **2. Security & Passwords**

Your data security is paramount. In the **Security** section:

- **Change Password:** To update your password, click **Change Password**.
- **Verification:** For your protection, the system will send a 6-digit verification code to your email. Enter this code along with your new password to complete the update.
- **Super Admin Setup:** If you joined via a social login and haven't set a password yet, you’ll see a prompt to **Set Password** to enable traditional login methods.

## **3. Team Management (Admins Only)**

If you have administrative permissions, the **Members** tab allows you to manage your team:

### **Adding New Members**

1. Click **Invite User**.
2. Provide their **Name** and **Email**.
3. **Role Selection:** Choose a role (e.g., Analyst, Manager, Admin) to define their permissions.
4. **Temporary Password:** The system can auto-generate a secure temporary password. Share this with the new member for their first login.
5. **Preferences:** Decide if the account should be pre-verified by you or if they should receive email notifications.

### **Managing Existing Members**

- **Edit Details:** Update a member’s role, name, or preferences at any time.
- **Revoke Access:** Use the **Delete** icon to remove a member from your organization.
- **Restore Members:** Accidents happen! You can view recently deleted members and click **Restore** to reactivate their account and history.

## **4. Billing & Subscription**

Keep track of your organization's financial status in the **Billing** area:

- **Plan Status:** View your current plan name and its status (Active, Past Due, etc.).
- **Renewal Dates:** See exactly when your subscription is set to renew or when your license expires.
- **Usage Bars:** Monitor how many **Data Sources** and **Team Members** you have used versus your plan's total limit.
- **Management:** Depending on your plan, you can upgrade your service or manage your cancellation settings directly from this widget.

## **5. Credit Allocation**

Admins can precisely control how resources (AI Queries and Dashboards) are distributed among team members.

### **How Allocation Works**

By default, team members use the organization's global pool. However, you can set specific "Allowances" for individuals to prevent any single user from exhausting shared resources.

### **Allocation Steps**

1. Navigate to the **Members** list and find the user.
2. Click the **Allocate Credits**.
3. **Select Source:** Choose whether the credits come from your main **Subscription** pool or from a specific **Addon/Credit Package** you purchased.
4. **Set Limits:**
   - **Max Queries:** The maximum number of AI questions the user can ask.
   - **Max Dashboards:** The maximum number of dashboards the user can create.
5. **Save:** Once you hit **Allocate Credits**, the user's limit is updated instantly.
6. **Usage Monitoring:** You can return to this screen anytime to see how many of their allocated credits they have already used.

### **Reverting Allocation**

If you want a user to return to the shared organizational pool, you can **Cancel Allocation** for that specific user. Any unused credits assigned to them will be returned to the organization's main balance.
