## **1. Managing Database Connections**

The main **Database** page lists all your active connections. From here, you can:

- **Add New Connection:** Connect a new Data Source. The system will guide you through entering your credentials (Host, Port, User, Password).
- **Security First:** MyQuery uses **schema-only** access. We never store your raw data on our servers; we only encrypt and store the "map" (schema) so the AI knows how to answer your questions.
- **Edit Connections:** Update connection strings or rename your database display names if your infrastructure changes.
- **Remove Data Sources:** Disconnect databases that are no longer needed.

## **2. Manage Tables: The Command Center**

By selecting **Manage Tables** from any database card, you enter a specialized workspace for organizing your data.

### **Schema Explorer (Sidebar)**

On the left, you can quickly jump between different connected databases and browse all available tables. Click any table to open its detailed management view.

### **Table Configuration (Header)**

Once a table is selected, you can control its visibility and how the AI understands it:

- **Table Status:** Toggle a table between **Active** and **Inactive**. Inactive tables are hidden from the AI Chat, keeping your workspace clean.
- **AI Context (Description):** Click the **Edit** icon to provide a natural language description for the table (e.g., _"This table contains all customer transaction data since 2021"_). This significantly improves the AI's accuracy when answering questions.

## **3. Investigating Your Tables**

The table management area features two powerful views to help you audit and understand your data:

### **Columns View**

This view shows the "blueprint" of your table:

- **Schema Details:** View a list of every column, its data type (e.g., Integer, Varchar), and its current description.
- **Searchable Toggle:** You can decide if specific columns should be "Searchable." Turning this on tells the AI that this column is important for filtering and finding records.
- **Column Documentation:** Just like tables, you can edit descriptions for individual columns to clarify what specific fields mean (e.g., 

### **Data View (Raw Interaction)**

Need to see exactly what's inside the table? Switch to the **Data** tab for a high-performance spreadsheet experience:

- **Live Preview:** Browse real rows from your database in real-time.
- **Searching & Filtering:** Use the header search bar or the advanced **Filter** button to narrow down rows based on complex logic.
- **Ordering:** Click any column header to sort the data instantly.
- **Pagination:** Effortlessly navigate through large tables with millions of rows using the page controls at the bottom.
- **Column Visibility:** Hide or show specific columns to focus only on the data points that matter to you.

## **Configuration Tips**

- **Refresh Schema:** If you add a new column to your database, use the **Refresh** button in the Table Selector to update MyQuery’s map.
- **Less is More:** Only activate the tables you actually need for your reports. This makes the AI faster and reduces the chance of ambiguous answers.
- **M2M Tables:** Many-to-Many relationship tables are automatically detected and don't count against your plan's table limits!
