title: "Activity"
description: "The Activity page is your organization's audit log and command center for past investigations. It provides a transparent view of all data interactions, allowing you to track performance, revisit past discoveries, and audit usage across your team."

## **1. Activity Overview**

The page is divided into two primary sections to help you track different types of work:

- **Queries:** A chronological log of every question asked to the AI and the resulting SQL execution.
- **Dashboards:** A history of dashboard creations and updates, showing who built what and when.

### **Performance Metrics**

At the top of the page, you'll find high-level statistics for your organization:

- **Total Queries:** The count of all data requests made.
- **Avg. Execution Time:** How fast your database is responding to questions.
- **Success Rate:** The percentage of queries that were completed successfully without errors.
- **Avg. Rows Returned:** The typical size of the datasets your team is working with.

## **2. Searching & Filtering**

With potentially thousands of activities, MyQuery provides powerful tools to find exactly what you're looking for:

- **Keyword Search:** Type any part of a question or a dashboard name into the search bar to find matching records.
- **Date Range:** Filter activities by timeframes like _Today, This Week, Last Month,_ or use the **Custom Range** to select specific dates on a calendar.
- **Team Member:** (Admins only) Filter the feed to see the activity of a specific user.
- **Data Source:** Narrow down results to queries run against a specific database.
- **Status Filter:** Quickly find queries that **Succeeded**, **Failed**, or those that were **Long-running** (taking more time than usual).

## **3. Interacting with Past Queries**

The Activity feed isn't just a static list—it’s interactive:

- **View Details:** Click on any query to see the full SQL logic, the exact time it was run, and the number of rows it returned.
- **Re-run Query:** Found an interesting insight from last week? Click the **Play** icon to execute that exact query again on the latest data.
- **View Results:** Instead of re-running, you can often view the **Results Table** or the **Chart** from the last time the query was executed.
- **SQL Editor:** For advanced users, you can view the generated SQL, make manual tweaks, and run the modified version to refine your results.
- **Copy Logic:** Quickly copy the SQL code to your clipboard to use in other reporting tools.

---

## **4. Understanding the Status Icons**

- **Green Check (Success):** The query ran perfectly and returned data.
- **Red "X" (Failed):** The query encountered an error (e.g., a database connection issue or a syntax error).
- **Yellow Clock (Long-running):** The query was successful but took longer than the performance threshold to complete.

## **5. Exports & Sharing**

(If enabled for your role) You can export your activity logs to CSV or PDF for external auditing or reporting. This is useful for monthly reviews of data usage and team performance.
